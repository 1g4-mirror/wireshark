    Mongo: Avoid infinite loop in dissect_op_msg_section

    If the size of a a OP_MSG data section is indicated as -1, that
    leads to advancing the offset by section_len + 1, or zero, which
    causes an infinite loop.

    The total message and section lengths in Mongo are signed int32s;
    it is impossible for them to be negative, and impossible for the
    section length to be INT_MAX (since the message length includes
    the length of the four byte headers and flag bits.)

    Throw an error to avoid the offset moving backwards, an infinite loop,
    or signed integer overflow.

    Also update some URLs to their new locations.

    Fix #20724.

    H.248 Annex E: Fix ToneDetection Tone ID List dissection

    This is a sublist of Enumeration, which maps to a SEQUENCE OF
    INTEGERS in ASN.1, though the main H.248 dissector takes care of
    the SEQUENCE OF part. The other Tone ID lists, like hf_h248_pkg_cg_sig_pt_tl,
    are already h249_param_ber_integer. Note this fixes the last parameter,
    because implicit is a boolean; to use h248_param_uint_item the last
    parameter be a length.

    This caused a problem once gbooleans (which are actually 32-bit
    integers) were replaced with real stdbool bools.

    Fix #20666.

    cli_main: Fix freeing argv array

    ISO C allows for argv contents to be modified by user code.
    Therefore we cannot depend on receiving back the same argv
    contents that were passed to user code. Otherwise it
    introduces a potential crash when freeing possibly
    nulled pointers.

    Instead we introduce a GPtrArray auxiliary data structure
    to hold on to a private reference to the allocated memory.

    packaging: Use _docdir in RPM spec; fix __bindir on SUSE

    SUSE for some reason defines their __cmake and __ninja macros to
    depend on _bindir; _bindir depends on _prefix and is the location
    where the binaries for the package being built will be installed.
    This isn't the case with __make, which is just defined as /usr/bin/make

    But just because we could be installing to a different prefix doesn't
    mean we want to run CMake or Ninja out of the directories we're
    installing to. We want to use the system package CMake and Ninja.

    Also, the newest SUSE doesn't have _docdir set to _datadir/doc by default,
    so use the _docdir macro (which exists on RHEL/Fedora, and presumably
    all RPM distributions) for the document file locations.

    Switch to the OpenSUSE 15.6 container, since OpenSUSE 15.5 has

    We can build against Qt6, though (following upstream) only
    with a later gcc than the default, due to C++17 support.

    packaging: Fix RPM on SUSE

    SUSE and RedHat use slightly different meanings for the same
    %cmake_build macro - SUSE calls the builder (ninja or make)
    directly, whereas RedHat calls cmake --build instead.
    That makes the syntax a little different to call a target other
    than the default.
