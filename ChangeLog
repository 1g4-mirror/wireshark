    Rename "EF PHB" to "EF"

    Remove "PHB" from the description of the EF DSCP code point.  The term
    PHB (per-hob behavior) is applicable to all of the DSCP code points,
    but none of the others have it in their description.

    Update packet-nfapi.c

    0 = pass, 1 = fail, according to SCF222_5G_PHY_API.
    In C, 0 is false, 1 is true.
    Therefore, true is CRC_ERROR and false is CRC_CORRECT.

    dfilter: Extra value_string checking and comments

    It's possible to register multiple fields to the same abbreviation.
    We don't actually enforce field compatibility, but even if we did,
    FT_FRAMENUM is considered compatible with other integer fields.
    So it's theoretically possible to register a integer field with a
    value string to the same abbreviation as a FT_FRAMENUM with a non-NULL
    strings - FT_FRAMENUM overloads that field to store ft_framenum_type,
    and treating it as a value_string *will* crash. (I don't believe
    we have any such fields currently.)

    Add a couple other comments regarding treatment of value strings -
    we shouldn't actually optimize tests against strings that represent
    value strings in cases where multiple fields are registered to the
    same abbreviation and don't share exactly the same value string.
    (See #19111 for a specific example.)

    Protobuf: Don't truncate the string value to ITEM LENGTH for dumping

    Don't call proto_tree_item_ret_display_string, which truncates the
    returned value to ITEM_LABEL_LENGTH (at least since
    commit 603354203b608a0d94b91c61791b2ec3052a870b, possibly earlier),
    but call proto_tree_item_ret_string, which doesn't, when getting the
    string value to add to the JSON view (and later to output the JSON
    view's value via output formats like JSON or PDML.)

    Don't create the string a second time, either, if there's another hf.

    Fix #20392
