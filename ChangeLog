    Epan: Cleanup plugins only after all possible calls are made

    Since wmem has a facility to register for callbacks on 'free all' and
    destruction of the indicated allocator, a plugin can have such callback
    registered when epan is going through its cleanup before the program
    exists. Therefore the unloading of plugins has to be done after the
    registered callbacks from wmem to the plugins are made.

    Fixes #19579

    Qt: Fix crash when closing TimeShiftDialog before redissection done

    Commit f67eccedd9836e6ced1f57ae9889f57a5400a3d7 made it so that
    the TimeShiftDialog doesn't have a nested event loop with exec.
    That's good, but that means that an AutoConnection between
    TimeShiftDialog::timeShifted and PacketList::applyTimeShift is a
    DirectConnection, which means that TimeShiftDialog::applyTimeShift
    waits for the packet list redissection to finish before the function
    calls enableWidgets and returns.

    The user can close the Time Shift Dialog while the packet list
    redissection is still ongoing. As the TimeShiftDialog is also now
    DeleteOnClose, this means that when the redissection finishes (or
    is canceled via ProgressDialog) the TimeShiftDialog will try to update
    its widgets after they've been deleted, causing a crash.

    To prevent, make the connection between the TimeShiftDialog and
    the PacketList a Qt::QueuedConnection.

    editcap, libwiretap: Don't use array of initial DSBs after freeing

    wtap_dump_close frees the passed in GArray of initial DSBs, used
    by editcap for injecting DSBs from a file or list of files.

    Add functions to increment and decrement the reference count of
    an array of wtap blocks. Dereference the block of initial DSBs
    in wtap_dump_close() instead of freeing it. In editcap, before
    closing the dump file in cases where we intend to open a new
    file (e.g., with a maximum time value or a maximum packet count),
    reference the block.

    Fix #19782, #19783, #19784.
