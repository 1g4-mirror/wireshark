    GitLab CI: Use Mino mc on Ubuntu

    Switch to minio mc on Ubuntu. Unlike `aws s3 cp` it can copy multiple

    idl2wrs.c: Fix generation of idl2wrs-dissectors

    This hasn't worked since 8ca846436d14da6079a51da4111a860e0f357c36
    (September 24, 2016) because the code actually depended on atoi
    failing silently and returning 0 when faced with a non integer.

    Switch the ws_strtou32 call to being *after* the checks for the
    special values '*' and ']'.

    We don't need to copy the result into a string buffer and compare,
    because ws_strtou32 with a NULL end of string pointer will err in
    the cases where the comparison would fail.

    WiSUN: correct offset logic errors

    Change local variable `offset` from a `guint8` to a `guint` in two
    functions with loops, to prevent a potential infinite loop from
    overflowing the variable.

    Change `dissect_wisun_nrie()` to return the number of bytes it
    dissected, since that's how `dissect_wisun_hie()` seemingly expects it
    to behave. It previously returned the new offset at the end of what it
    dissected -- which is how several `dissect_...()` functions in this
    dissector are expected to behave, but this is not one of them. (This
    inconsistency adds friction when maintaining this dissector and should
    be addressed at some point.)

    radius: Switch back to the previous FILE if an $INCLUDE doesn't open

    Save the previous FILE pointer so we can switch back to it if a
    file name listed in an $INCLUDE doesn't open, instead of leaving
    it null, so that any subsequent read attempts (or attempts to close
    it at the end) don't crash.

    Fix #6466. (The other parts of the issue have been fixed.)

    log3gpp: Fix read of uninitialized data.

    Clang static analysis reports that subsecond_decimals_buf[1] through [3] might
    be used uninitialized.  This is because the array is being NUL-terminated, but
    the NUL-termination is not relevant (and is in fact erroneous) when the array
    is being directly evaluated one character at a time and assumed to be only
    digits.

    The NUL-termination can be removed (and the array size reduced by one) and
    instead we directly initialize to '0' any characters not read from the source
    line.

    Qt: Allow the Learn links to word wrap

    Over the course of the 4.0 series the Sharkfest, Discord, and Donation
    links were added to the Welcome page. They are now the limiting factor
    in the application page width. For some language translations they
    are even longer.

    Some of the "Learn" links have multiple words, like "Questions and
    Answers," or "Wireshark Discord." Allow the multiword link titles
    to word wrap.

    Fix #19861

    Qt: Fix byte view text wrapping with Qt <= 5.10

    There's at least two concepts that might be described as the width
    of a string of characters; the width of a box that surrounds the
    existing characters, and the width that measures where to place
    the next characer. The former has always been obtained from
    QFontMetrics::boundingRect(text).width(), but prior to Qt 5.11
    QFontMetrics::width(text) gave the latter. This led to many people
    using the latter when they usually wanted the former.

    Thus in Qt 5.11 QFontMetrics::width() was deprecated for
    QFontMetrics::horizontalAdvance().

    In our case, we really want horizontalAdvance, because we're manually
    drawing characters. It makes a difference because for non ASCII
    characters we use the UTF-8 middle dot character, which has a lot
    of necessary blank space before and after it where other characters
    shouldn't be drawn. With some fonts and scalings using the width
    of the bounding rectangle makes our lines too short and the end of
    the ASCII text wraps, when there's lots of non ASCII / middle dots.

    So on Qt 5.10 and earlier, use the width() function that is
    equivalent to horizontalAdvance (een though it is marked obsolete
    for later versions.)

    Qt: Make it possible to clear Comments from all interfaces

    We only add an entry for an interface if it has a non-empty Comment
    (aka user description). That means we need to make sure that the
    map has a default empty QStringList for that pref so we can set it
    to the empty string; otherwise, if some interfaces have Comments, but
    the user tries to the clear the comments from all interfaces, it won't
    work. The map won't have an entry for that pref, so it won't get
    changed to the empty string.

    The same is true for the Monitor Mode setting.

    SPRT: Fix crash

    SDP can setup a RTP conversation with a setup frame before the current
    frame, which changes the dissection on the second pass. If in the period
    in the middle there is a SPRT packet, it can be dissected differently on
    the second pass, and the SPRT conversation data won't be found on the
    second pass.

    Fix #19559 (at least prevent the crash. There's some more cleanup that
    should happen.)
