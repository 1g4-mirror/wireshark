    Commit 9c75c1dc18199ea6b282177e21fe1d445af5bbb3 introduced

    X11: ConfigureWindow: Fix 'window' and bitmask fields.

    Only 1 of the 4 bytes comprising the window field was actually
    being read, causing the value to be incorrect. The offset pointer
    was correctly increased by 4 on the following line, so this is
    clearly just an oversight.

    The configure-window-mask field was being dissected using the
    "window value mask" bitmasks. It was interpreted correctly when
    dissecting the actual fields, though, so this is clearly just
    another minor oversight.

    Before:

      window: 0x00000001
      configure-window-mask: 0x0003, background-pixmap, background-pixel
      x: 448
      y: 156

    After:

      window: 0x03800001
      configure-window-mask: 0x0003, x, y
      x: 448
      y: 156
