    TCP: Fix location of Timestamp Option values

    When syn cookie support was added, a new tree was added under
    the TCP timestamp option TSVal. Unfortunately, it was done
    so by reusing the proto_item pointer that was pointing to the
    tree item for the top level of the option, before it was done
    having text appended to it.

    Add a new proto_item pointer so that the text gets appended
    to the original place.

    ringbuffer: Use g_path_get_basename to find the last component

    On Windows, the path separator can be either G_DIR_SEPARATOR
    or '/' (G_DIR_SEPARATOR_S).

    Just use g_path_get_basename and g_path_get_dirname rather
    than reinventing them, or worrying about which directory
    separator we've passed to the function.

    X11: ConfigureWindow: Fix 'window' and bitmask fields.

    Only 1 of the 4 bytes comprising the window field was actually
    being read, causing the value to be incorrect. The offset pointer
    was correctly increased by 4 on the following line, so this is
    clearly just an oversight.

    The configure-window-mask field was being dissected using the
    "window value mask" bitmasks. It was interpreted correctly when
    dissecting the actual fields, though, so this is clearly just
    another minor oversight.

    Before:

      window: 0x00000001
      configure-window-mask: 0x0003, background-pixmap, background-pixel
      x: 448
      y: 156

    After:

      window: 0x03800001
      configure-window-mask: 0x0003, x, y
      x: 448
      y: 156

    extcap: Add ability to enable SHA-1 algorithms

    libssh 0.10.0 removed SHA-1 based keys and algorithms from its
    default configuration, though they are still supported. We
    ship with 0.10.5 in Windows and macOS now, and many Linux
    distributions are on 0.10.x as well.

    Add the ability to re-enable SHA-1 RSA keys, MAC, and KEX algorithms
    with a preference to ciscodump, sshdump, and wifidump.

    This will be a little easier in 0.11.0, where it's possible to
    just specify the algorithms you want to add to the default list,
    instead of having to specify the entire list.

    Fix #19510. Fix #19594

    Qt+WinSparkle: Don't close the main window in the can shutdown callback

    Apparently in Qt6 closing the main window can exit the Qt event loop,
    which means that WinSparkle never gets the notifications it needs to
    proceed.

    WinSparkle will call quit() shortly thereafter via the shutdown
    request callback, so the main window will still close at approximately
    the same time.
