    profinet-mrp: Always subtract the OUI length

    The length for the OUI needs to be removed from the remaining length
    even in the unknown case.

    Really this whole function should be rewritten to pass in a subset tvb
    instead of a length, to minimize the chance of buffer issues.

    Fix #19986

    Qt: Don't idle dissect with the read lock held

    It's not a time when we're idle, and worse, it can
    lead to messages like:

    The capture file "bittorrent-comp_4.pcapng.lz4" appears to be damaged or corrupt.
    (pcapng: total block length 3722677760 is too large (> 134348832))"

    when saving a large file still doing idle dissection into a new
    format (new compression or new file type).

    Qt: Stay in packet list history until we're done with history

    The functions that set in_history_ to true always set it to false
    when they're done. Sometimes selectionChanged gets called twice
    when in the middle of history (e.g., for clearing the selection
    as well), and this causes history navigation back multiple packets
    in history to cease to work.

    packetBB: Skip over the extended type before retrieving length

    The packetBB TLV parsing parses the header twice, once to get
    the length in order to add the tree item with the correct length
    (rather than calling proto_item_set_len or similar later), and
    once actually adding the items. In the initial retrieval of the
    length it fails to increment the offset if the extended type is
    present according to the flags bit.

    caneth: Initialize the other fields of the can_info

    The CAN-ETH protocol documents says that it is only for
    8 bytes of data, i.e. CAN_CLASSIC.

    This dissector wasn't updated when the bus_id field was introduced.
    Explicitly initialize it to zero.

    6LoWPAN: Fix base of Page Number field

    This is added with proto_tree_add_bits_item and as an integer (from
    4 bits), which means that the base needs to be an actual display
    base and not the width of a field (as used for FT_BOOLEAN fields
    with a nonzero bitmask, which is not when using add_bits_item).

    It happens to work because 16 is BASE_PT_SCTP, and the field happens
    to be FT_UINT16, which is compatible with a port type.

    Fix #19934

    lbmsrs: Do not throw exceptions in heuristics

    Subtracting two unsigned integers, and comparing them to a
    small number, is not a reliable way to see if enough bytes
    are left in the packet due to wraparound. To make things
    clearer, use the tvbuff API when we want to check if enough
    bytes remain.

    Noticed in the captures attached to #19921
