    Websocket: Fix decompression flag handling

    The first fragment of a multiframe Websocket message is not
    necessarily the first fragment of the Websocket conversation.
    We need to save the opcode and per message compression flag from
    the first fragment of the reassembled message, not the first
    frame of the conversation. Some conversations may have control
    frames.

    Also, since according to RFC 6455 5.5, control frames can be
    interjected in the middle of a fragmented message, can have
    a payload, and MUST NOT be fragmented, we do not save the first
    frag payload and per message compression flag until after checking
    if the frame is a control frame.

    Use proto_tree_add_ret_boolean in a couple places where possible.

    addr_resolv: Fix extra host files

    Extra host files are only added to a list once at program startup,
    so that needs to be epan scope. They are re-read each time the
    address resolve scope is reset, but there's no way to clear the
    list of files. Since it's only used by tshark, this shouldn't be
    a problem.

    tls-utils: Fix exporting secrets with renegotiation

    Close the client random when inserting it into the hash map of
    used client randoms. Just inserting the pointer means that when
    renegotiation occurs, the data changes, which causes the last
    used Client Random to be exported N times instead of the N different
    Client Randoms.

    This can be tested with the tls-renegotiation.pcap test capture
    in the repository.

    Qt: Fix extcap interface toolbar Qt6 regression

    QComboBox Data is stored as a QVariant. In Qt5, QVariants are converted
    for equality comparison if possible, but in Qt6 conversion only happens
    in a more limited number of situations. In Qt5, QVariants from a
    QByteArray and a QString can compare equal if the QByteArray would
    convert to the string, but they never compare equal in Qt6.

    The payload passed to the Interface Toolbar is a QByteArray (UTF-8).
    Don't prematurely convert it to a QString (UTF-16) because passing it to a
    function that converts it to a QVariant, because then it won't compare
    equal to QVariants from the same QByteArray not converted.

    Also note that Qt5 and Qt6 convert QByteArrays with internal '\0'
    differently.

    Fix #20354
