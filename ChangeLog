    RELOAD Framing: Call the matching wmem_free scope

    If we wmem_alloc in file scope, we have to wmem_free in file_scope
    instead of trying to call g_free on that address directly.

    Thrift: Fix fallback when subdissector fails

    - Ensure all sub-dissector errors use THRIFT_SUBDISSECTOR_ERROR instead
      of THRIFT_REQUEST_REASSEMBLY to effectively fallback.
    - Reset proto_depth before fallback on generic dissector.

    tests: Add checking for Lua support to release tests

    Lua support is optional in general, but if --enable-release
    is given to the tests (as on the macOS Intel and Arm package
    builders) fail if support is missing.

    Prevent #20029 from happening again.

    CMake: Respect TEST_EXTRA_ARGS, run release suite when requested

    With the transition to using pytest, the CMake variable TEST_EXTRA_ARGS
    stopped being used; several of the CI jobs are passing it, to no effect.

    Note that this only has an effect with the `ninja test` target.
    Running pytest directly requires passing in parameters manually.

    However, we also install pytest inside a venv on gitlab macOS runner
    jobs. So use the test target on the macOS package jobs, and instead
    pass the text arguments to pytest on the GitLab macOS runners.

    commview: fix handling of NCFX files that aren't ours.

    If commview_ncfx_read_header() returns WTAP_ERR_BAD_FILE, it doesn't
    mean we got an error, it means it's probably not a Commview NCFX file.
    Check for that and, if we get it, free the error message and return
    WTAP_OPEN_NOT_MINE.

    pcap: use nanosecond resolution for hardware lcap files.

    The resolution on Ixia hardware-capture lcap files appears to be higher
    than 1 microsecond; assume it's 1 nanosecond.

    Also:

    Make a Boolean variable a bool rather than an int.  Rename it to
    skip_ixia_extra, to clarify that it's for the Ixia formats.

    Use a null buffer argument to wtap_read_bytes() to skip over the size
    information.

    Point to the issue for adding support for Ixia lcap files.

    Ping #14073.
