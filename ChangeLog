    Qt+WinSparkle: Don't close the main window in the can shutdown callback

    Apparently in Qt6 closing the main window can exit the Qt event loop,
    which means that WinSparkle never gets the notifications it needs to
    proceed.

    WinSparkle will call quit() shortly thereafter via the shutdown
    request callback, so the main window will still close at approximately
    the same time.

    See discussion in https://github.com/vslavik/winsparkle/issues/237
