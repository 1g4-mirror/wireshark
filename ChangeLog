    POSIX compatibility: Include lowercase Windows header on MinGW

    Windows is "case-aware" in that even though it's case-insensitive by
    default, NTFS file systems (and others) store case-sensitivity and it
    is possible to force Windows into a case sensitive mode:
    https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/case-sensitivity

    The Windows header "BaseTsd.h" has that capitalization, officially, in
    Windows, but is always lowercase in MinGW. If cross-compiling with MinGW
    from a Linux system, or in some other situations, the include file can
    be treated case-sensitively and fail.

    One option is just to always include as lowercase, though that can break
    in the rare case where someone has made Windows case-sensitive.

    Ensure that SSIZE_MAX is defined under Windows

    BaseTsd.h does not define SSIZE_MAX, and only defines MAXSSIZE_T
    in certain circumstances where cplusplus is defined. SIZE_MAX is
    defined so long as stdint.h is included.

    Qt: fix incorrect center frequency calculation in wireless toolbar

    Center frequency for channel 149, 80MHz should be 5775MHz, but current
    version generates 5770MHz. When any channel between 149-161 with 80MHz
    is input, current version produces incorrect results. These result in
    not being able to set such configs for monitor interface.

    Fix this by reusing code from iw.

    Zigbee Direct packets relayed over BLE interface will not have IEEE/MAC
    header, as a result 'ieee_hints' can be NULL.

    Changes part of this commit ensure, 'ieee_hints' is not NULL before it is dereferenced.

    epan: Fix LZ77 decoding when MatchLength is larger than 16-bits

    Read the 32-bit quantity before advancing the offset by 4 bytes
    in the case where the MatchLength didn't fit in 2 bytes.

    See the pseudocode in [MS-XCA] 2.3.4 for compression:
    https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-xca/b66751f2-be7b-4d20-a87c-5147c563ff2d

             If MatchLength < (1 << 16)
                 Write two-byte value MatchLength to OutputPosition
                 OutputPosition += 2
             Else
                 Write two-byte value of 0 to OutputPosition
                 OutputPosition += 2
                 Write four-byte value of MatchLength to OutputPosition
                 OutputPosition += 4

    wmem_map: Ensure that the hash multiplication factor is odd

    We multiply the hash results by a random integer before right-shifting,
    in order to guard against g_direct_hash being used with integer
    (or pointer as integer) values whose upper bits are identical, such
    as 16-bit port numbers or pointers allocated nearby each other.

    However, this random integer should be an odd random integer; the
    larger the power of two that evenly divides x, the more the hash
    table space collapses and for smaller tables. The effect becomes
    noticeable if x becomes divisible by 2^15 (because of the hash table
    of the all the header_field_info, which has ~2^18 entries) and
    starts to go into denial of service levels when divisible by powers
    of two above 2^24 or so.

    Ensure that it's odd by adding 1 if even. This produces a uniform
    random distribution over the odd 32-bit integers.
